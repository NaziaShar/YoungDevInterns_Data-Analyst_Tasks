Titanic Gender Submission Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic gender submission dataset from Kaggle, performing data cleaning, visualization, and basic analysis. The code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and provides an all-in-one solution for exploring this classic machine learning dataset.
Tasks Completed

Task 1: Data Cleaning
Loaded the gender_submission.csv dataset
Removed duplicate PassengerId entries
Validated and corrected Survived values (ensuring only 0 or 1)
Displayed cleaned data sample

Task 2: Data Visualization
Created two informative visualizations:
Pie chart showing survival distribution
Histogram of Passenger ID distribution

Task 3: Data Analysis
Calculated key statistics:
Total passenger count
Unique PassengerIds
Overall survival rate
(Extended analysis available when combined with main Titanic dataset)
Technical Implementation
Python 3 with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn
Interactive Jupyter Notebook format
User prompts for saving cleaned data

How to Use
Place both gender_submission.csv and (optionally) train.csv in your Jupyter home directory
Run all cells in the notebook
Follow prompts to save cleaned data

Files Included
Titanic_Gender_Submission_Analysis.ipynb: Main notebook with all code
cleaned_gender_submission.csv: Output file (optional save)

Requirements
